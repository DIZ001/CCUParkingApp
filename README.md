# ccu-parking-app

Hey guys, this is Frankie.  I decided to start a new repository, so as the commit history isn't skewed, and so that we could start on a blank slate.

Hailey was here :)

I added a ParkingLot.java file - Jonathan

CHARLES (C.J.) HAS ADDED MARKERS TO THE MAP AT THE MAJOR LOTS, LIMITED THE ZOOM LEVEL, AND MERGED TO THE INDEX HTML (11/08/16 8:22 PM - 11/08/16 10:15 PM). MY PLANS FOR TOMORROW INCLUDE A GRAPHICAL OVERLAY OF SOME COLORFUL BLOBS TO REPRESENT THE LOTS. PROBABLY MEANS A TAD OF PHOTOSHOP WORK.  (NOT REALLY FEELING THE IMAGE THAT WE HAVE. SEEMS A LITTLE CLUSTERED TO TRY AND MERGE OVERTOP OF GOOGLE MAPS). ALSO, I WANT TO ADD SOME POP UP INFO WINDOWS, INSTEAD OF HAVING THE LAME "LOT XX" POP UP WHEN MOUSING OVER.
