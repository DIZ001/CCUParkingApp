Hey guys, this is Frankie.  I decided to start a new repository, so as the commit history isn't skewed, and so that we could start on a blank slate.

Hailey was here :)

               (11/10/16 6:30 PM - 11/10/16 9:00 PM) --- Failed attempts to incorporate GPS navigation. Original plan was to have a button in the info window that says "get me here" and it would start navigation. Instead, trying to incorporate directions from current location to selected lot from the buttons below the map. Geolocation + GPS interaction is tough.
